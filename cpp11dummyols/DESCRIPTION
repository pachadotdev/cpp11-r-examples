Description: This package was written to show how to use cpp11 and solve a specific 
    Linear Algebra problem, which is to obtain the OLS estimator, in the most naive\
    way.
    Use this only for elemental examples, not for actual estimation. 
    There is a good explanation about why R's lm() function uses a QR decomposition 
    instead of a naive computation of the form (X'X)-1(X'Y) as I did here.
    See http://madrury.github.io/jekyll/update/statistics/2016/07/20/lm-in-R.html.
    The goal of this package is to demonstrate some features of the cpp11 package.
