Description: Build this package with gcc or clang on any computer with an Intel 
    or AMD processor to compile the contained C++ code with OpenMP support. It also
    works if you install libomp via Homebrew on macOS.
    The Makevars file is set up to use the OpenMP flag for the compiler, and 
    commenting its lines generates a build that works, but the functions will
    use one thread.
    The goal of this package is to demonstrate some features of the 
    cpp11 package, and this also demonstrates how to create named and unnamed lists.
